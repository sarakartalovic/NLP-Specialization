# NLP-Specialization
Natural Language Processing Specialization by DeepLearning.AI

The Specialization consists of 4 courses:
Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
  - Use of logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, translate words, and use locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors.
Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models
  - Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.
Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models
  - Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions.
Natural Language Processing with Attention Models
  - Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering, and build chatbots. Models covered include T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and more
